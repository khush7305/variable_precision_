# variable_precision_
I have implemented the IEEE paper "Variable Precision Approximate Floating Point Multiplier For Efficient Deep Learning Computation".
The main aim of this paper is to propese a multiplication method where significant reduction in power and area is obtained at the expense of a little bit loss in efficiency.
I have added all the files that were created to implement this paper in the .v format.
I have used Xilinx Vivado to implement the paper.
